Its a bot which for spesific website(Sabanci BannerWeb) , you have to download "chromedriver version 78"  and put in project folder.
note : maybe its not working atm because some ui elements changed on bannerweb anyway its easy to use selenium and u can modify it for yourself , but i will update it when add drop terms come. BTW u should change password and id with ur own su id and pass. 
For people who want modify it , this is selenium documentation : https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started/
